            I'm from Arizona, USA. We have 5 kids, 3 here and two in heaven. I love spending time with my family, reading, learning about whatever I feel interested in at the moment. I was currently pursuing a degree in dental hygiene, I was accepted in to start that program this fall. But after many big changes in our little families life, I feel pulled in another direction. That is why I am here. I really have no real world experience but I am excited to learn and find out if this is a path I would like to pursue. The little I have done I have really enjoyed and find myself wanting to do more and more.
